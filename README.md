# Openexperience

**Professional expertise for AI agents.**

openexperience is an open specification for packaging professional expertise -- the judgment, processes, and domain knowledge that professionals use daily -- into a format any AI agent framework can consume.

## The Problem

LLMs have knowledge, but not experience. For instance, they can write a follow up email, but they don't know when to send it, why they should multi-thread in Sarah, or that this prospect intially mentioned a competitor in a first email, and that their persistent quiet might mean a deal risk and to use a battle card. That judgment comes from years of professional practice performing and training in a role.

Openexperience bridges that gap. It defines a standard way to capture professional expertise as portable, framework-agnostic packages that give AI agents the judgment and workflows of a seasoned professional.

## What's in an Experience Package?

An experience package is a directory of markdown and YAML files:


| Component        | Format            | Purpose                                                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Manifest**     | `experience.yaml` | Package metadata, dependencies, component listing                  |
| **Orchestrator** | `orchestrator.md` | Entry point. How the agent should use this experience.             |
| **Persona**      | `persona/`        | Agent identity and behavioral rules                                |
| **Functions**    | `functions/*.md`  | Individual capabilities (markdown instructions + YAML frontmatter) |
| **Processes**    | `processes/*.md`  | Multi-step workflows of processes that map across multiple functions |
| **Tools**        | `tools/*.yaml`    | Abstract interfaces to external systems                            |
| **Knowledge**    | `knowledge/*.md`  | Reference material (methodologies, frameworks, guidelines)         |

Only `experience.yaml`, `orchestrator.md`, `functions/`, `persona/`, and `README.md` are required. Everything else is opt-in based on what the expertise demands.

## How It Works

### 1. Get the package

An experience package is a directory of files. There's no code to install and no runtime dependencies. Clone it, download it, or copy it into your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openexperience/radiant-sales-expert
```

### 2. Bind your tools

The package manifest declares what tools it needs (e.g., `crm`, `email`, `calendar`). You map each abstract name to whatever you already have -- your HubSpot instance, your Nylas integration, your Google Calendar API. The package doesn't care how your tools work, only that they can answer the declared operations.

```yaml
# Example: binding abstract tools to your concrete implementations
tools:
  crm: my-hubspot-mcp-server
  email: my-nylas-integration
  calendar: my-google-calendar-api
```

### 3. Your framework consumes the package

The framework reads the package files and uses them at runtime:

- **Orchestrator** tells the agent when/how to use this experience and which capabilities to reach for
- **Persona** becomes the agent's system prompt
- **Functions** become capabilities the agent can invoke
- **Processes** orchestrate multi-step workflows (processes, decision heuristics etc) across functions
- **Tools** declare what external systems the package needs to communicate with (e.g. CRM, email, calendar) you bind them to your implementations
- **Knowledge** becomes reference material loaded into context

### 4. The agent has professional judgment

Your AI agent now knows *when* to send the email, *who* to CC, *which* methodology applies, and *what* the next best action is -- using your real data from your real tools.

### No code in the package

This is the key design choice. An experience package is a **prompt engineering artifact with structure**, not a software dependency. It contains expert instructions, data requirements, and process definitions -- all in human-readable markdown and YAML. Any framework can consume it:

- Read the markdown directly as system prompts
- Map functions to agent/skill definitions
- Map processes to workflow chains
- Map tools to your integration layer (MCP servers, API clients, database queries, etc.)

## For Framework Authors

To make your framework consume openexperience packages:

1. **Parse `experience.yaml`** to discover components and requirements
2. **Load `orchestrator.md`** into the agent's context so it knows when and how to use the experience
3. **Provide a tool binding mechanism** so users can map abstract tool names to concrete implementations
4. **Load persona and knowledge** into the agent's prompt
5. **Optionally support processes** for multi-step orchestration

See the full [specification](spec.md) for details on each component type and the runtime consumption model.
