Our goal is to build a 'expert packages' SPEC/standard, that can be installed into AI agents (such as OpenClaw) to allow capable agents to become domain experts.

For example, an expoert package could turn a capable model such as Claude Opus 4.6 into:
1. an expert b2b sales rep who can manage your sales for you, interact with external API's and basically, do your job.
2. an expert Linkedin marketer who researches trends, follows your value props, drafts Linkedin posts and schedules them for you.
3. an expert scientific researcher, who looks up research, cross references and looks for novel connections - documenting it's process in your preferred notetaking app.
4. an expert legal advisor who examines your new situation in your legal duristiction, examines known precedents and draft contracts for you.
5. a doctor who understands your medical history, stays up to date on research that might impact you, and keeps a running timeline of your medical issues.
6. A customer support agent that receives support tickets, looks up company docs, does research and reports back to customer

This repo is for THAT only.

There are sub-repos under experts which is a specific expert package, however we are purely focused on the spec/standard/readme in this repo. 

We are defining and creating the global standard for expert packages, going forward.
