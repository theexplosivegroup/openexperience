# openexperience Specification

Version: `1.0`

## 1. Overview

openexperience is an open format for packaging professional expertise into files that AI frameworks can consume.

An experience package captures:

- Role judgment (how to think)
- Decision heuristics (how to decide)
- Workflows (how to execute)
- Domain references (what to reference)

### Design Principles

- **No code in the package**: packages are markdown and YAML only.
- **Framework agnostic**: any agent framework can consume the files.
- **Agentic-loop native**: processes are playbooks for an agent loop, not an executable DSL.
- **Portable and readable**: experts can author and review files directly.

## 2. Package Structure

An experience package is a directory with the following structure:

```text
experience-package/
  README.md
  experience.yaml
  orchestrator.md
  persona/
    identity.md
    rules.md
  functions/
    *.md
  processes/            # optional
    *.md
  tools/                # optional
    *.yaml
  knowledge/            # optional
    *.md
```

### Required Components

- `README.md`
- `experience.yaml`
- `orchestrator.md`
- `persona/` (at least one persona file)
- `functions/` (at least one function file)

### Optional Components

- `processes/`
- `tools/`
- `knowledge/`

### Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case file names where practical (for example `classify-email-intent.md`).
- Function and process files use markdown with YAML frontmatter.
- Tool files use YAML.

## 3. Manifest (`experience.yaml`)

The manifest is the package index and metadata source.

### Required Fields

- `spec` (string): spec version for this package format, for example `"1.0"`.
- `name` (string): package name.
- `version` (string): package version (SemVer recommended).
- `description` (string): short package summary.
- `components` (object): lists package component files.

### Optional Fields

- `author` (string)
- `license` (string)
- `requires` (object): dependencies such as abstract tools.

### `requires.tools`

`requires.tools` is an array of abstract tool names the package expects at runtime.

Example:

```yaml
requires:
  tools:
    - crm
    - email
    - calendar
```

### `components`

`components` lists files by component type so frameworks can discover them without scanning every file.

### Complete Example Manifest

```yaml
spec: "1.0"
name: radiant-sales-expert
version: "0.1.0"
description: B2B sales expertise for inbound deal triage and next-best-action
author: Openexperience Community
license: MIT

requires:
  tools:
    - crm
    - email

components:
  orchestrator: orchestrator.md
  persona:
    - persona/identity.md
    - persona/rules.md
  functions:
    - functions/classify-email-intent.md
    - functions/determine-next-action.md
    - functions/compose-response.md
  processes:
    - processes/inbound-email-triage.md
  tools:
    - tools/crm.yaml
    - tools/email.yaml
  knowledge:
    - knowledge/meddpicc.md
    - knowledge/competitive-battle-cards.md
```

## 4. Orchestrator (`orchestrator.md`)

The orchestrator is the package entry point. It tells the agent:

- When to use this experience
- Which functions or processes to reach for
- How to route between scenarios

### Format

- Plain markdown
- No frontmatter required

### Runtime Consumption

Frameworks should load orchestrator content into persistent context (for example, system prompt/bootstrap context) so the agent can route correctly at runtime.

## 5. Persona (`persona/`)

Persona files define identity and behavior.

Recommended files:

- `persona/identity.md`: role, voice, and style
- `persona/rules.md`: behavioral constraints, priorities, and guardrails

Additional persona files are allowed.

### Runtime Consumption

Frameworks should load persona content into persistent context with the orchestrator.

## 6. Functions (`functions/*.md`)

A function is a self-contained capability. Functions contain domain instructions, heuristics, and output expectations that can be used on demand inside an agent loop.

### Required Format

Each function file must include:

1. YAML frontmatter
2. Markdown instruction body

### Function Frontmatter Fields

Required:

- `name` (string)
- `description` (string)

Optional:

- `inputs` (array of objects with `name`, `type`, optional `description`)
- `outputs` (array of objects with `name`, `type`, optional `description`, optional `enum`)
- `tools` (array of abstract tool names)
- `knowledge` (array of knowledge file references)

### Function Body Requirements

The markdown body should include:

- Clear instructions
- Decision rules / evaluation heuristics
- Output formatting guidance

### Example Function

```markdown
---
name: classify-email-intent
description: Determine the intent and urgency of an inbound email
inputs:
  - name: email_body
    type: string
  - name: sender_context
    type: object
    description: CRM context for sender, deal stage, and history
outputs:
  - name: intent
    type: string
    enum: [objection, question, buying_signal, churn_risk, scheduling, other]
  - name: urgency
    type: string
    enum: [high, medium, low]
  - name: reasoning
    type: string
tools:
  - crm
knowledge:
  - knowledge/competitive-battle-cards.md
---

## Classify Email Intent

Given email body and sender CRM context, classify intent and urgency.

### Decision Rules

- If the sender is in a late deal stage and mentions a competitor, classify as `objection` and `high`.
- If there has been >14 days of inactivity and the reply is short/hesitant, classify as `churn_risk`.
- If the email asks product or technical details, classify as `question`.

### Output

Return:
- Intent
- Urgency
- Reasoning (1-2 sentences)
```

### Runtime Consumption

Frameworks should expose functions as readable/invokable capabilities (for example, skills) and load them on demand instead of always preloading all function content.

## 7. Processes (`processes/*.md`)

A process is a multi-step workflow that coordinates tool usage and function usage.

Processes are authored as markdown playbooks, not executable workflow code.

### Process Frontmatter Fields

Required:

- `name` (string)
- `description` (string)

Optional:

- `trigger` (string): event that commonly initiates the process
- `inputs` (array): starting data requirements
- `outputs` (array): expected final outputs
- `functions` (array of function names): discovery and indexing support
- `tools` (array of abstract tool names): discovery and indexing support
- `scratchpad` (string): recommended working file path pattern

### Process Body Requirements

A process body should include:

- Context preamble: when and why this process runs
- Ordered steps section
- Completion section with expected output

### Checklist Pattern (Recommended)

Use markdown checkboxes for step tracking:

- `- [ ] Step ...`

This gives the agent explicit progress cues in agentic loops.

### Scratchpad Pattern (Recommended)

Processes may instruct the agent to write intermediate results to a file (for example under `./scratch/`), improving:

- Context recovery
- Auditability
- Resumability

### Example Process

```markdown
---
name: inbound-email-triage
description: End-to-end handling of an inbound sales email
trigger: new_email
inputs:
  - name: message_id
    type: string
outputs:
  - name: draft_response
    type: object
  - name: classification
    type: object
  - name: recommended_action
    type: object
functions:
  - classify-email-intent
  - determine-next-action
  - compose-response
tools:
  - email
  - crm
scratchpad: ./scratch/triage-{message_id}.md
---

## Inbound Email Triage

Run this process whenever a new prospect email arrives.
Follow every step in order and check it off after completion.

### Steps

- [ ] Create a scratchpad file at `./scratch/triage-{message_id}.md`.
- [ ] Fetch the inbound email using the `email` tool and record sender, subject, body.
- [ ] Fetch contact details from `crm` using sender email and record account context.
- [ ] Fetch active deal details from `crm` and record stage, amount, competitors.
- [ ] Read and apply `classify-email-intent` using email + CRM context; record output.
- [ ] Read and apply `determine-next-action`; record output.
- [ ] Read and apply `compose-response`; record draft response.

### Completion

Return:
- Draft response
- Classification
- Recommended action
```

## 8. Tools (`tools/*.yaml`)

Tool files define abstract interfaces to external systems.

They define what operations are needed, not how integrations are implemented.

### Tool Fields

- `name` (string): abstract tool name referenced by functions/processes
- `description` (string)
- `operations` (array)

Each operation includes:

- `name` (string)
- `description` (string)
- `input` (object shape using simple type declarations)
- `output` (object shape using simple type declarations)

### Type System

Use readable simple types:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `object`
- `array`

Complex fields can define nested `properties` using the same simple types.

### Example Tool

```yaml
name: crm
description: Customer relationship management interface
operations:
  - name: get_contact
    description: Retrieve a contact by email address
    input:
      type: object
      properties:
        email:
          type: string
    output:
      type: object
      properties:
        contact_id:
          type: string
        name:
          type: string
        company:
          type: string
        deal_stage:
          type: string
        last_activity:
          type: string
        notes:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string

  - name: get_deal
    description: Retrieve active deal details for a contact
    input:
      type: object
      properties:
        contact_id:
          type: string
    output:
      type: object
      properties:
        deal_name:
          type: string
        amount:
          type: number
        stage:
          type: string
        competitors:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
        close_date:
          type: string
```

### Runtime Binding

Frameworks bind tool names declared in experience files to concrete implementations (for example MCP servers, API clients, or internal services).

## 9. Knowledge (`knowledge/*.md`)

Knowledge files contain reference material the agent can use while executing functions and processes.

Examples:

- Methodologies
- Frameworks
- Battle cards
- Templates
- Policy references

### Format

- Plain markdown
- Optional frontmatter fields such as `name`, `description`, `tags`

### Runtime Consumption

Frameworks may:

- Load selected knowledge into persistent context
- Load knowledge on demand via read/skill mechanisms

The strategy should consider context budget and file size.

## 10. Consumption Model (Framework Authors)

This spec does not require a workflow engine. It defines portable artifacts that frameworks can map into their own agent runtime model.

### Recommended Runtime Flow

1. Parse `experience.yaml` to discover package metadata and components.
2. Load `orchestrator.md` and persona files into persistent agent context.
3. Register functions/processes as readable capabilities (for example skills).
4. Bind abstract tools to concrete integrations.
5. At runtime, the agent reads the relevant process, follows checklist steps, reads functions on demand, calls tools, and returns outputs.
6. Optionally use scratchpad files for intermediate process state.

### Portability Rules

- A consumer framework may adapt runtime mechanics.
- A consumer framework should preserve file semantics and intent.
- Packages should remain valid without framework-specific code.

## 11. Versioning

### Spec Version

Packages should include a `spec` field in `experience.yaml`.

Current spec version: `1.0`.

### Package Versioning

Package authors should use SemVer for `version`.

Recommended interpretation:

- `MAJOR`: breaking changes to package structure or function/process contracts
- `MINOR`: backward-compatible capability additions
- `PATCH`: backward-compatible fixes and clarifications

## Non-Goals

To keep openexperience portable and simple, this specification intentionally does not define:

- Template interpolation syntax (for example `{{step.output}}`)
- A typed executable workflow DSL
- A mandatory execution engine
- Full JSON Schema requirements for tool declarations
